Project Two required us to have a csv file that contained many food items and to use algorithms to find the top combination of items that had the highest calories and fit within a certain weight limit. The two algorithms are Greedy Algorithm and Exhaustive Search. The greedy algorithm does not give us the best combination of items, but it does find a good one pretty quickly. The exhaustive search does find us the best combination of items, but it takes a long time to do it, so we had to use a limited size for the exhaustive search in order to complete it within a reasonable time frame.
